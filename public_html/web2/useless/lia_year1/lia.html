          The Bauhaus was a German art school opened in 1919, by the architect
          Walter Gropius, originally in Weimar. It was a school where
        </p>
        <p>
          students were free to express themselves and push the concepts of art
          and functionality to their absolute limit. Bauhaus promotes
          functionality over look; the most important part of a design is how
          well it works, anything that doesn't serve to amplify it's use is
          unnecessary and should be removed. Throughout its lifetime, the
          Bauhaus existed in three different cities: Weimar, Dessau, and Berlin.
          Finally, in 1933, it was closed down by the Nazi regime for being a
          centre for "Communist Intellectualism."
